        <h1>Are you also tired? </h1>
        <h2>Tired of this hard life?</h2>
        <h3>Didn't understand the things that people tell?</h3>
        <p1>I am tired to do these theories without practicality. It makes a big sense that today’s difficult world made everyone so tired of doing that thing that makes the way to success.</p1>
        <p2>Nowadays All you are learning Is that type of information that comes in the unknown list. You will watch a learning video, lectures, or anything that you will learn is not fixed even in your mind. You watch it take it and then what happened is if anyone asks you to tell them what you have learned, at that time your brain remains blank like a hole.</p2>
        <p3>You are just wasting your potential. Remember that do smart work instead of hard work.
            From now, You have to set a vision of that what you are learning, a consistent mind, full attention to the lecture if it is important otherwise leave it and don’t waste your time. After taking the lecture find clarity on if it is correct or not. If that information is correct so revise that.</p3>
        <p4>Stress is also a factor in almost everyone’s life.
            Take things important but not in a way that gives you stress. If a person is in stress he/she would not suppose to do that work perfectly. Learn to take less stress but not things lightly.
